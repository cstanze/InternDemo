## Running

There's not much to it, you can open this file in a browser - preferably one that isn't obselete or outright dead (I'm looking at you *Netscape Navigator*). Another way of running this project is by using [`serve`](https://npmjs.com/package/serve). When running using `serve`, it's as simple as navigating to the root directory of this project and running `serve` on the command line after installing the tool. After which you can view the project in a browser - again not something as antiquated as *InternetExplorer* - using the address `localhost:5000`
